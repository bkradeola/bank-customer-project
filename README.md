## Insight Generated:
The Insight generated has been presented in a data visualization format on the dashboard, with total number of customers as 4,014 (Male 2,165, Female 1,849) with balance contribution from Male as 54.28% and 45.72% attributed to Female. Larger number of the banks customers are with white collar jobs (1,955) while blue collar job and other contributed 1,049 & 1,010 respectively.

Analysis as revealed that the most active age range of customers is 31-40 with total balance contribution of Gbp 64,464,920.52 and total of 1,605 customers.
Insight on region also show clearly that the most performing region is England with 2,159 customers, over Gbp 80m balances while the least performing region is Northern Ireland with just 211 customers and less than Gbp 5m accumulated balance.

## Recommendation:
The bank should build on the gains achieved in England and create more products that can further strengthen the loyalty of the most active age group of 31-40years with white collar jobs. Marketing activities should be improved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in order to improve the bankâ€™s market share in those regions. 
Contribution from Age group 21-30 years is very low considering the prospects of people in this age range. Products suitable to attract them should be designed and deployed efficiently for improvement.
